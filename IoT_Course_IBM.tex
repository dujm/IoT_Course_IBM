\subsection{What is IoT?}
\begin{itemize}
\item IoT is a network of interconnected things, objects, devices, and systems that connects and transmit data and exchange data among them.
\item The data exchanged is collected, analyzed and acted on them. 
\end {itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{What is the value of IoT?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Collecting  data from IoT based devices (such as wearables and smart appliances) enables business to learn more about their operating environment. 
\item This way, businesses can identify and act on the potential to create new value. 
\item Value by unlocking your revenue from existing products and services, value by inspiring new working practices and processes, value by changing or creating new business models or strategies.
\item The potential of Internet of Things lies on the intelligence.
\end {itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Why is IoT so special ?}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{You go where the data is}
\item \textbf{Provide a service}
\item \textbf{Discrete industries come together (e.g. wellness + fitness + nutrition}
%%\item \textbf{Performance-enhancing apparel}
\item A variety of particles, domains and applications allow collection of data from a vast number of things not hindered by location. 
\item Those things can be configured in a number of different ways. Some with processor, storage, keyboards, screens, but somehow or another they must communicate with the internet either directly, or via an internet connected device. 
\item Standard connectivity which can send data to the cloud from anywhere. 
\item Storage and applications that can analyze this data lead to new insight and revenue opportunities. There are consistently new sources of data for businesses. 
\item And businesses are creating systems of insight by unlocking data from billions of interconnected devices. IoT takes computing power out of the data center, and onto the cloud. The cloud is critical for devices beyond the reach of the data center. To connect and communicate from anywhere in the world through open standards. Internet of Things gives business access to product usage data they never had before. 
\item Personalized services designed from usage data creates opportunity for new sources of revenue. 
\item You have probably notices some of this with advertisement after a Google search or with suggested videos and YouTube. \item Personalize and instant are the new expectations for engagement. But there is so much more data, 90\% of it which is created at the edges of IoT that is never even captured, analyzed, or acted upon. 
\item And from the data that is captured, 60\% of it loses its value within milliseconds of being generated. This means that most of the data is never turn into insight.
\item 

\subsection{How does IoT works}

\item How does IoT work?  \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSIPNhOiMoE&feature=youtu.be}
